# üèÜ matchly League API Documentation

## Overview

The matchly League API implements a **box-based promotion/relegation system** where players are grouped by skill level and can move between boxes based on performance. This creates dynamic skill-based matchmaking that continuously adjusts to player abilities.

## üéØ Core Concept

**Box System:**
- Players are randomly assigned to boxes when league starts
- Each box contains 4-6 players (optimal: 5 players)
- Players in each box play round-robin matches
- After each round, top performers promote up, bottom performers relegate down
- Creates natural skill-based matchmaking over time

### 6. Promotion/Relegation

#### Process Promotion/Relegation
```http
POST /api/leagues/{leagueId}/promotion
```

**Response:**
```json

  "message": "Promotion/relegation processed successfully",
  "league_id": "uuid",

      "from_box": 1,
      "to_box": 2
    }
  ],
  "total_movements": 2
}
```

**Promotion/Relegation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ Top 20% of each box promote to higher box
- ‚úÖ Bottom 20% of each box relegate to lower box
- ‚úÖ Middle players stay in current box
- ‚úÖ Players in highest box can't promote further
- ‚úÖ Players in lowest box can't relegate further
- ‚úÖ Records all movements in promotion history
